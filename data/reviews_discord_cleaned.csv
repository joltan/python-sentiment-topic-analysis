the only reason this app is popular is because it's had a monopoly for a very long time, but it has literally never worked as intended, and they don't care as long as people keep paying them. locking emojis, reactions, or anything resembling reasonable bandwidth behind a paywall is just trashy of them.

2022-03-20,Paladin,"I'm reposting my review here as well so people can read my experience to make up their own minds about using Discord. 

Before my account was disabled 1 week ago I knew it was becoming a bigger and bigger issue that discord was just banning more and more people at will with their automated systems. I just didn't believe i would get hit with their bs. Yes there are spammers and abusers on discord. Yes there are issues. However their coding programs have also victimized legit users who do not deserve an instant account ban. I count myself amongst those. I'm happy that I never spent money on nitro or anything like that. I would never want to support the kind of direction Discord is going now.

You are not even told in an appeal what part of the TOS you broke. They do not care about their users at all. They know they don't need us as they got enough users now and can get away with it. But eventually you are going to lose more and more members to other competitors. Look at Facebook its going down hill as well. I believe the best time of discord has passed and its only going down hill and eventually getting back smaller years from now and someone else will take the center stage.

The customer support on discord doesn't exist. I mean they just can't follow up with the support tickets or they ghost you. What discord is doing is turning happy users who haven't hurt a fly into sad, angry and disappointed users who leave discord. Even if its a false flag like my case they will just say its correct. Trusting their bots are 100% accurate. Which any programmer knows isn't possible.

Even if I get my account back which is like 10% chance I'm not changing this review because I'm seeing so much damage done by Discord towards people who build up their lives on their platform and take it away in a second, that is really shameful.",⚠️ Discord has turned to a shameful service ⚠️,1,BE

2021-01-25,Professor Zephyr,"Horrendous app.

I've been using Discord since 2017 and the app is progressively getting worse and worse. It's horrible. It legitimately makes me want to quit using the internet as a whole.

There are nearly no upsides to using Discord at this point. Public servers have nothing but mic spamming trolls and vile children and even grown adults who take pride in making your day miserable. 

In smaller servers, there are pedophiles and child predators roaming the app daily. This app is also horrible at monitoring viruses and malware that are distributed daily. On another note, they ban users for nearly no reason. Friends of mine have received bans they cannot appeal because they are terminated of suspected ""fraud"". None of these friends even know how to do this. Also, Discord is horrible at monitoring messages that are dropped in servers. Some Discord users will go out of their way to dox, or leak personal information (such as real names and birthdays, emails and even passwords). Discord is also horrible at taking legal action to those who scrape info from servers. This information usually includes registered emails, server IDs, message IDs, user IDs and even avatars. These emails are then looked up in database dumps and more sensitive info can be retrieved. Because Discord allows you to report message IDs, user IDs, server IDs and emails, this info is public. Scrapers literally retrieve this info from their API, which can be publicly used. Because account terminations are based entirely off of message links, users can report messages that are simply suggestive or a joke, and you can be terminated for this. 

Discord also has an awful reporting system if you haven't gotten that point earlier on in my report. Response times are decent, but in order to successfully report users, you have to copy a message link which is enabled by their ""Developer Mode"" option. Unfortunately, if you simply delete that message, Discord cannot terminate that person. Screenshots are also not allowed. Someone infected your PC with RAT malware, allowing them access to your entire PC and you threatened to report them? Simple fix! All they have to do is purge their chat with you, which can easily be done with a Github program that is very accessible on the site. Your daughter got caught up with the wrong person on the app and sent them naked pictures or suggestive pictures at all and the pedophile deleted his messages? That's too bad. Discord doesn't allow screenshots and your daughter may receive an account termination if she was under the age of 13, or sent naked pictures in a non-NSFW chat, because both of those go against their Terms of Service. Discord also does not allow video files or audio files to be reported. Some admitted they have your info and they are going to release it? Too bad, no message link to grab (because there are no messages if you're in a voice call) means no report. Because you cannot report a user directly from their app, you have to do so through their FAQ section on their site (which is a little difficult to navigate at times, not even going to lie), users cannot report people through their app, making reporting people even more difficult. Awful to think about, isn't it?

I hope someone from the discord staff team sees this because I mean every bit of this review and I am truly grateful for the app. I'll start this review by stating I've been on discord for a little over 5 years now, since I was 13. I never had a stable home or constant friends, I'd move ever year and the only thing that's stayed with me is discord. I've met some of my best friends on this app and have at least 2-3 people who I'm sure will stay with me for life. I've also met the love of my life on the app, someone who I've been with for two years. Before I got this app I had lost my dad and since then I've been going through some of the toughest years of my life but a lot of my friends on discord as well as my lover have kept me going.  I can't be thankful enough, I have my bad moments, we all do but this app has saved me and helped me so much. So to the discord team, thank you. For all the hate you guys get and how fickle the community can be I'm so happy you guys stuck it out and made this person's life better. Discord truly is like a home to me and I will always be remember and be thankful for the app. I aspire to work for discord one day, as a little sign of my gratitude.

I suggested them sending backup codes to my phone and even went so far as to take photo's of my ID cards (current and previous one) as well as a screen shot of my phone provider to show I owned my phone number. They just magically stopped trying to help, it's like their support is run by either kindergardeners or old boomers, considering how inept they seem to be at providing even the most bare essential of help.

We have conversations around the world but the servers they put our channel on is never optimal for the group. The first person to join a chat channel sets the server location and causes the quality to be degraded.

They recently released threads and forums and both features are terribly implemented and designed. 

Their Nitro subscription is geared for kids and hardly provides useful features for businesses. It is very difficult to get the features you need as a business as they require certain social requirements that don't exactly fit our businesses objectives.

2020-05-10,Marcius Wong,"Writing the review during COVID19 period.

I have been using Discord for over 3 years now, it's safe to say I really enjoy the entire concept of this fabulous communication platform.
The simplicity and sophistication of the functions and user interface of the app is boundless. You can do 'anything' from simply chatting to playing text games or even creating your own Discord bots. 

The complexity of the sophisticated functions have also been massively simplified to the point where just about anyone can perform the sophisticated functions like bot creation which requires basic scripting knowledge which can be learnt off the internet in a few hours.

You can create a server and create specific subsections called channels to maintain a neat and tidy community or wreak havoc by creating a server with roles like 'Big Boss' or 'Wumpus Overlord' to assert dominance and create channels titled 'spam', 'spam-1', 'spam-2' with no context apart from server members spamming like crazy in the server.

Apart from the amazing functions and memes of Discord, the company also values their customers. They create hilarious ads and I love their marketing structure. Discord has amazing staff that interact closely with their users via Social Media platforms like Twitter or through Official Discord Servers! They also keep in touch with the latest memes and times. 
For example, right now in the COVID19 situation, it's hilarious seeing Discord try so hard to incorporate a myriad of new functions to support the need for home-based learning and online meetings etc.
From allowing video calls and conferencing to be held within servers to incorporating noise-cancelling features, Discord has very well cemented itself amongst the best video conferencing and telecommunication app.

Heck, the best part is...

2020-07-08,Ena Ilferd,"When I used Discord, I tried to get help from customer support. That is when I got automated robots giving me messages that look like they were written by comedic kids rather than professional adults. If you do not meticulously take care of the process of trying to get those childish robots to do their ""jobs"", then those robots will reject your request to get your problem solved. Customer support service in Discord is a complete joke. I can't even get into my Discord account anymore that won't get deleted because I keep failing to send the right phone number from my own phone to verify my Discord account. Once I changed my phone number from my phone service provider the 2nd time, I was done with Discord. Because I don't have time to deal with an extremely faulty platform from Discord that's not run by professional humans in the customer support service as much as the customer support service is run by childish robots who don't know how to talk with common sense to the point that it's autistic. I need real people with real common sense that will actually help me in the Discord customer support service because robots are not very good still in the year of 2020. Besides that, Discord's system bans people for no logical reason sometimes to the point that it's stupid. Never trust your money with Discord is what I recommend you do. People have had unexpected charges in their bank account from Discord's shady business model. If you are honest about you being against homosexuals, the transgender community, feminists, Muslim feminists (even though Muslim feminists are hypocrites because Muslim feminism is an oxymoron because Islam and feminism are complete opposites), and other liberal things, your account could likely get banned from the Discord system because Discord is controlled by multicultural hypocrisy that paradoxically doesn't accept people with different point of views because Discord is a biased echo chamber. I've known people who have had their accounts permanently deleted without their consent because what they did on Discord was against Discord's hypocritical policies on how to socialise with people on Discord.

So just a little update, I've been trying to help the discord community by reporting stuff that breaks TOS or the law like discord request, But from the 5 things i've reported nothing has been done & nobody has even bothered getting back to me.

First case: Reported a paedophile with evidence among with others to get these vile people removed the platform, What happened? Nothing...The guy is still on the server now laughing at everyone because he got away with it so discord just made us all look like dumbasses.

Second case: Reported a guy who was threatening to bomb places and mosques and after the recent events i fount this to be highly unacceptable, What happened? Provided evidence and IDs and got ignored. 

Third case: Reported a guy who was selling leaked files and copyrighted content on his discord server, reported that and what happened? They claimed they cant delete a server for that? so nothing happened.

Forth case: Reported a server that was self botting thousands of members with evidence and was using the fake member count to trick people into buying ads on his server, Sent evidence and got told ""Botting isn't a big issue ;)"" Okay? So everyone can just bot servers? That seems right, doesn't it?

Fifth case: Reported 2 members with video clips and screenshots of them telling me they're going to ddoss my community which they did (had logs from the host) and discord told me its not their problem? pretty sure ddoss threats is against your TOS? But at this point, they don't care about paedophiles so i'm not surprised they don't care about ddossing.

I messaged Discord's support with evidence that I wasn't spam but reading other reviews, it seems that Discord is completely out of reality and are just banning people on subjective terms so I won't bother using their website anymore or services.

All in all, I do not think Discord deserve the popularity that they currently have with such a system that is anti-loyal to their members.

After sending in a ticket, with a screen shot attached, I received an automated response requesting that I reply in order to receive real people to talk to. I did, rather irritated but accepted that it was probably to catch and filter through spam tickets.

Then I received a person who gave me a basic ""turn it off and on again"" run around. After a lengthy and rather furious reply, they then told me ""oh it's because your nitro was paid for via Apple, I'm closing this ticket."" It took them DAYS to reply to me and they took ZERO accountability. My friend did not receive a refund and currently I still have no ability to use my emojis.

2020-08-01,Uncle Sam,"discord is a great way to talk to your friends, even if your not a gamer! however, they added streaming mode to dms, and its so annoying and awful. for what i know, theres no way to turn it off. normally i would use screen share, which is nice and easy to turn on and use. 
but now, i gotta deal with the stream mode, and its so annoying. turning it on is harder, since i have to turn it on and off a good amount of time before it actually works, and shows my screen to others. when using it, it uses a lot more energy on my computer than normal screen share (i don't have a gaming computer tho). 
i hate it. my friend and i tried it a few days ago for the first time, and we were in tears, laughing at how bad it is. 
i guess streaming mode is fine if you haven't tried screen share. but when you have tried screen share, the streaming mode is a downgrade compared to screen share. 

other than this, discord is really good, and if you wanna connect with friends, or make new ones in servers, you should check it out!","good, but the new streaming mode in dms is bad",3,DK

2023-05-28,tracy  betteridge,"We recently joined this gaming platform to play snooker which we were enjoying for a very short time.   Until another player was illegally using gamesmanship tactics to try and win.  Having reported the matter to the 2 people who were running this we were then subjected  to alot of serious abuse by this player and others joining in.  This is actually cybercrime  and a criminal offence. I am not a person that uses vile language or swears and i did not retaliate but then i found out that the 2 guys running this on their server also started with their abuse and actually added abuse to a text message that i had sent and they were also throwing untrue accusations around and trying to make out that i had written or said these vile things which i hadn't at all and other players also knew i hadn't as they had seen all that had been sent via myself or these players/ server owners.
We have now left this platform as have other friends following this. But the cybercrime has been reported as there is alot of this it seems happening on this platform.   
Its absolutely disgusting the way this is being allowed to carry on and quite frankly should be closed down. Nobody should have to be subjected to this least of all when you have done nothing wrong . Its a real shame as this is being run by the wrong people who seem to enjoy this kind of behaviour and think they know it all even though they don't and its unacceptable. Hopefully now this will close down following the law enforcement investigations.

I had a free month of nitro from discord, it came with two ""boosts"" I went to boost a server and it only let me do it once. I had not thought about the second boost as a problem- it was a free subscription anyway so I thought ""whatever."" 

When I started paying for my subscription it only let me use one again, even though you pay for two. So, I contacted support and my god, I wonder how they are even still going with how terrible their service is. I sent them screen shots of the amount of boost I used (two in total of two months which should have been four.) including the dates I used them, the date of my subscription payments, my account info, my banking info, I sent proof of anything. But then I got an email saying ""nothing is wrong."" Yes. Something is wrong, I'm paying for something I'm not getting. After so long without an email back I told them I'm canceling my subscription till they solve this.  

I almost feel like they did this on purpose because I was paying 9.99$ as a promotion price and if I restart my subscription it will be 12.99$ a month for the same subscription.

Well, will it still be protection if I take them to court? Make them submit the image in question as evidence. So the judge, jury, lawyers, artists, and stenographer can see it? What about courtroom observers? And will the person in the image appreciate being subpoenaed into showing up and testifying that it is of them, it is indeed non-consensual intimate imagery, and they complained about it?

2022-04-05,Joe Baker,"NOTE: I want to say that Discord has changed the way they ""process"" these requests since this occurred. In June 2021, their Privacy Policy stated:

""In addition to the functionality available through the “Settings” of the Services, in which you can correct, update, amend, or delete certain personal data, you can also request other modifications from us directly. Please write us at privacy at discord.com with the words “Personal Data Request” in the subject or body of your message, along with an explanation of what data subject right you are seeking to exercise.""
This clause has since been removed. The privacy at discord.com was the ONLY email mentioned on that page at that time. Since then they have added a clause that states: ""You can contact Discord’s Data Protection Officer at dpo at discord.com."" HOPEFULLY this is a dedicated point of contact for data requests now. Here is my main review:

They do not comply with GDPR requests.

My account was disabled summer of 2021 for reasons they would not tell me. This happened while I was using the account, so I knew exactly when it happened.

I used their GDPR contact point (privacy at discord.com) to send them a data request for my account's data. After all, I wasn't told why I was banned, and I didn't want to lose all of my information.

The initial email stating my account was disabled stated that they anonymize/delete user data within 14-30 days after disabling an account.

Here's how they got me: 
The timeframe for them to respond to a GDPR request is 30 days. Yet they delete account information within 30 days after an account is disabled. I figure that since I sent the GDPR request minutes after my account was disabled, they would simply hold off on deleting my data until my data request was processed.

Wrong! They didn't acknowledge my data request, stating the email privacy at discord.com is only for questions about privacy and not for data requests. They haven't responded to any later emails.

Also got email from discord saying account was disabled because of it possibly being compromised. Then support stated that I should use reset my password, can't, the scammer enabled MFA after the account was stolen, not by user. 

Discord replies with: 

""Based on the findings of our investigation, we are unable to remove multi-factor authentication on your account due to privacy and security reasons.
 
In order to regain access to your account, you will have to use the backup codes provided to you when you initially signed up for MFA."" 

Discord, the MFA was activated by the scammer not the user. I do not have the backup codes provided to me since I'm not the one who signed up for MFA. 
Is there no way to try to access this as I have all the information about the account and I was the one who created the account in the first place. Is this completely inaccessible since it was compromised and taken by a scammer?

Have given discord proof of my ownership and can continue to give proof of ownership over account if needed. 

TLDR:

This doesn't make sense,
1. I have shown proof of my previous ownership of the account
2. I have given proof that it has been compromised, as well as discord disabling the account
3. I have multiple emails and password retries in order to try to get the account back
4. The account did not have 2FA previously before the compromise. 
5. Yet discord can not disable multi-factor authentication that was added after the compromise occurred, this was the action of the scammer, not the account creator and user.
6. Why is discord unable to disable factor authentication when it was clearly after a compromise in the account? Money was also lost through this account by the scammer using my debit card. 
7. The investigation concluded in my account just being unable to be fixed or given back after proof was given to support and offered to be deleted instead. This account can easily be recovered through the email if multi factor was turned off. It was taken over and hacked, that should leave discord capable of disabling multi factor on a compromised account to help the user get the account back not saying I can't because of “privacy and security reasons”.

They proceed to ""solve"" a request in order to deny any help to the user, to ignore them and their problem, just so they can close the ticket and not deal with it.

Support is great, however, without power.
The thing is, I created my account, verified myself against third parties as a certain trustworthy person and now I come back just to see that I can't login anymore. Not because I lost my login details, no, they are saved safely in Keepass, but because Discord changed the login form. Now they ask for the E-Mail and Password, however I created a special e-mail-address for it, I didn't store it though since it wasn't needed.
Well, so despite having the correct login details, they claim that I lost my account when I don't know the e-mail address.

Also, not sure who decided this, I can not change my e-mail through some identification, nor can they tell me the e-mail address, even though I would be able to prove being the owner with the correct user-pass combination.

Very disappointed. Might be discorapp didn't think about these cases, but at least they could offer a way to login with the old details to recover the e-mail address.

At the end they claim I lost my legit account, which is still active, just because they changed the login form. Despite me having saved the login details correctly.

Years later, they introduced 'Discord Game Store.' A feature no one asked for, something like Steam and Origin but for Discord so that you don't have to go to another client in order to play video games, do everything in one. They focused so much on this feature for so long that they forgot who made them, the community. They just wanted to be in that publishing space so bad and make even more money. Then they put in NSFW rules, where you can't be partnered (you will be denied partnership) if you have any NSFW content in your server/guild because Discord wants ""guilds to be open to everyone that joins, no matter the age."" Because Discord lacks a good CEO that doesn't want to put an age gate on Discord for certain servers/guilds, they just ruin everyone else's experience for a lesser crowd. On a side note though, streamers and content creators that are partnered get the blind eye when it comes to this and don't get departnered. How nice.

The company stopped implementing ideas on feedback.discordapp.com. Hell, they promised theme packs that changes the Discord UI, sounds, etc and that’s still nowhere to be found.

2021-10-11,Angel Victoria,"Discord was great until it wasn't. As a communication platform it's been absolutely perfect, however, my credentials got hacked by a bot and started sending ""free subscriptions"" to everyone in every server I was in. 

As you can imagine that adds up and is quite terrifying. I caught it fairly early on and my banking institution halted the fraudulent charges, however, any form of ""chargeback"" breeches Discord's ToS. My fault for not reading the fine print I suppose - But anyone would react swiftly if their financials were at stake. 

I reported the hack to them immediately but didn't know I had to handle the charges a ""certain way"" or risk losing the account being locked forever. At the same time I almost don't want the account back at all because I've no idea how it was compromised. I do want my information removed from it for obvious reasons - But I can always make a new one if needed.  

Discord has done nothing but send me automated responses that are neither helpful nor do they answer any questions. They locked the account NOT because of the reported hack (ironically I got another automated msg about it a week later saying there might have been suspicious activity) but because I dared to stop a bot from draining my accounts. 

Then proceeded to give me a warning about handling improperly. There has been zero support. Zero customer service. It's a trainwreck that THANK GOODNESS my financial institution is willing to help me sort out because sadly Discord is not. 

This was an unfortunate set of circumstances. There's no obvious rhyme or reason for it. The hack wasn't Discords fault, nor mine, though I suppose that depends on perspective - But my issue raised with Discord is the absolutely atrocious way they handled their responses and completely blew me off for over a week.

Basically I used this thing for 12+ months, probably more like 18, and then randomly when I go onto a NSFW Page on one of the servers I've joined I try to put my date of birth in (scorpio born in 1990), but its not accepting my birthdate saying ""Please Enter a Valid Date of Birth"".

I suspect in hind sight its because its the american format, and I'm a British User, but the moment I accidentally put in 2010 to see if I can get access I get banned.... ok its my mistake I'll take the full blame for that much.

HOWEVER thats where the good grace ends. I got into contact with a guy at Discord Support named ""Tulo"" who I was hoping after sending him 2 photos, one holding my Passport to prove my date of birth (and another on its own due to quality) and my Account Name in the same format TWICE and 1 in video format once that My account would be reinstated... but no, instead I got this robotic response EVERY SINGLE TIME - please bear in mind I had to CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT to get my 4 digit number because I couldnt remember what it was and didnt think it was important at the time:

- A piece of paper that shows your full Discord Tag (including your username and the last 4 digits following your username - ex: Wumpus#1234)

Step 2:
- Once you have taken the photo, please reply to this email with the photo attached

I don't mind delayed replies as I understand sometimes the queue can be overwhelming, yet to have different people respond to you on top of that and the fact that I had to repeat myself all over again with no resolution made me feel irritated over time.

I remember him accusing me of how I was sending multiple emails in hopes of getting different responses and ""threatening me"" to stop. How can I stop if my issue wasn't resolved or I didn't get satisfied with the ""canned responses"" that I received? In the first place, is that really professional to threaten your customer?

I believe that Discord has so much more potential as it stands at the moment and i believe that some extra things can improve Discord and make it so much better. I think that adding a whisper chat will really help Discord and the people that use it to play there games and talk with out any struggle. A whisper chat is a chat designed to communicate to other channels whilst being in one. When playing a game, you do not want to pause your game to click and join another channel, this could lead to stopping or ruining the game. What a whisper chat will do is allow people to talk with each-other when in different channels to make it easy to communicate. I believe that adding a whisper chat can be such an easy task however have such big impacts on improvement in a positive way.

Which again I did NOT have access to. I made a new account thinking I could bypass it and since I only have one email I had to make another email. So I made another email and made a new account. BUT of course, it said the same thing about needing a number. So from 8 am to 10 am I was contacting all my friends on Instagram and asked for their number to use. I finally got a number but I didn't realize I still had opened the discord tab with the new account I had just made to bypass the verification thing. So I used the number of my friend on that account. When I realized that it was the wrong account I deleted the number off that account and tried using it on my old account. BUT it said it was used on another account. I soon found out that there is a timeout on numbers and I had to wait at least 14 days before I can use the number again. So I went back to Instagram and asked for more friend's numbers. Some said no but I had another friend say yes. SO I finally got the number and made sure I was on the right account. I put the number in and my friend gave me the code and BOOM I was in I was so excited I saw I had a ton of DMS on discord but I needed to tell my other friends that it worked. I went to the tab with Instagram and told the friend who gave me the number and the original friend. When I went to go back to discord to check those DMS I saw that it had logged me out so I went to log back in and it said ""your account has been disabled"" Which I went to my email to see if the support team had emailed me a response to an email I sent an hour ago (still has not responded) and it said that my account was disabled because I was either

Discord rewards trying your best with public humiliation via condescending bots viewable to everyone on the channel, instead of maybe a polite little private pop-up that you can't do that. A big turn-off for the less technically advanced user. To put the cherry on the cake, the app lacks instructions or guides to actually tell you about these things to start with.

Clearly Discord have put many things above user friendliness, to the point where it actually goes out of the way to alienate its users with undeletable ""advice"" comments to point out your failings in front of the whole group (in my case over 50 people).

2021-10-20,Kai Ulric,"I have had my account for maaaany years and I help run several communities on it. I've never had a reason to contact their customer service, everything runs fine for the most part.

As of late discord seems to have a large number of bots trying to hack accounts to steal CC and PayPal info, sell accounts etc. I was always mindful of this, usually, they are easy to spot (this is my first time EVER being hacked on anything), it is a generic 'hey check this out' and a link. But recently hackers have taken it a step further. I got a message from a friend asking how I was doing, what was up, normal chat. We went on to have a 10-15 min conversation. He asked me to check something out for him, doesn't seem unusual because he runs big communities.

Well, it wasn't him, it was a hacker pretending to be my friend, so my account was hacked. Yeah, my bad... I didn't know this new strategy until it was too late and the friend hadn't reached out in any way to let people know they had been hacked and to be careful (which I want to say I started telling people asap and asked them to spread the word). This happened to many of my friends too, people who are very good at watching for bots, being tricked by these people acting like your friends to get your trust and make you feel nothing is out of the ordinary.

So yes, I was hacked. This was almost two weeks ago. I have sent in multiple tickets, 10+ emails updating my tickets on issues that the hacker is doing on my account. This included images of the hacker insulting my friend when he was trying to spread the info that I was hacked in one of my communities and openly saying that they were going to sell my account to someone else. I also DM'ed asking if there was anything else I could do to help the situation on Facebook and Twitter, plus multi @'s on Facebook and Twitter...

Discord has not contacted me in ANY way.

I am also a Nitro user (their paid service) and still, I can't even get a message from their customer service saying they are looking into my situation. It's been radio silence.

I have asked them to please switch ownership of some of the communities I run to friends who are the co-administrators that I trust so the hacker can't mess with them or delete them (some have hundreds of people in them) and still, zero contact and my admins have told me they still can't remove the hacked account (because I'm the main admin and they can't change that), so the communities are still in the hands of the hackers.

My friend was also hacked, and had their CC on their discord account for the renewal of their Nitro (paid account). The person who hacked them multiple times to charge HUNDREDS of dollars at a time to it, and had to cancel it. We all know what a pain that is, having to change all your account to a new card... they are also two-ish weeks in and still waiting for something to be done. 

Unlike other programs and websites, where if you try and change your info it either sends to a link in the email to do it, asks for a code from an email, or sends you the 'this info's been changed and if this wasn't you...' emails - I received nothing from Discord asking if this was done by me and if not here are the steps, or asking me to verify the change or even notified me there was a change.

I know some will say that Discord has the 2fa on it. Well, another friend of mine had that activated on his account. He said it did nothing to stop his account from being hacked because of the way the hack works. Once you click the link, when it logged you out, if you never logged in again before reinstalling discord, you would be fine. But the second you log in, it sends them your account 'token' and with the token, they can log in with any browser without needing any other info. 

In my case, I did uninstall and restart before trying again, but we also found out that whatever virus came with the link would auto reinstall discord and infect it again. In my case, we could not get it to stop reinstalling and had to wipe the drive.

I will say, the program is nice for building communities and having all your friends in one place. The voice chat and screen share are also nice. But when it comes to contacting them for help or customer service, this is one of the worst, if not -the worst- experiences I have ever had trying to get in contact with a company to get any form of help. Especially when I have a paid account. 

But they seem to have the time and staff to update their Facebook and Twitter about updating their store and asking you to spend money on their products... 

So TLDR; the program is nice, needs more work on their security, I wouldn't store Paypal or CC info on the account for your sake... because with my first-time experience trying to deal with their customer service, I'm not sure if they exist and if they do - it could be a long time before you actually receive any kind of help if something goes wrong with your account.","Good program, AWFUL customer service",1,US

Until now, i've been very much supportive of Discord, i have liked using it, both owning 2 servers and participating in many, occasionally sharing memes and generally, trying to be a good guy, helping people on videogame modding Discords, when i've been able (I'm a hobbyist 3D modeler/animator). I have even posted some tutorials for people on how to do basic modeling and animating. Few are those who would have a bad word to say about me. I have formed numerous friendships and connections over the years, and been a very active Discord user, using it pretty much everyday. 

And if not for my account being disabled, for NO reason, i would probably have been using Discord for many years to come. 

Seeing how unexistant the ""support"" they offer is, i can say that i feel scammed and angry. They could aswell just have no support at all, it would change nothing. Judging by my own experiences and those of others, who have been banned without a cause, i can say it, that my trust in Discord plummeted to below 0 in a manner of a few days. 

I have been seriously considering to abandon it for good, and if not for all the friends i have there, i would do so RIGHT NOW. And i still might do so within few days. This is no way to treat a honest customer.

If not for the fact that there is no support team, Discord might have been a decent platform. Oh well, time to see it for what it is and find another place to hang out, one that actually has a support, that is not an unfunny joke.

Do yourself a favor, do not have ANYTHING on Discord that you would feel bad for losing. This app is not realiable in long term.

2022-01-17,David Robert Duncan,"I have used Discord since the introduction of the platform. I have never had many issues with it apart from a few bugs here and there, so from that standpoint nothing bad to say. 
However why they got only a 1 star rating from me comes down to the fact my account had been hacked and when i contacted support via their website i would get a bot replying. You are asked if the bot helped, which in my case it did not and asked to reply to your email which i did. I have had no response from the Discord Support Team regarding this and have been informed by a friend that not only has he been removed from my server, that the hacker has also removed my friends and deleted my server. 
All the while nothing from the Support Team, they could have quite easily froze my account preventing activity as soon as i reported a possible hack while they investigated, however i have now lost everything and that after being a Discord member for over 7 years is more than disappointing its damn right careless. How many more people have to lose their accounts and personal details before Discord realises this is a serious issue that needs to be looked at if they want users to use and trust their platform.

In my own personal experiences, I've actually quite liked Discord for the past 4 years, but now they just had to throw a loyal customer under the bus.

It started when I had detached my phone number for a short time. I was immediately forced to add it back because this looked suspicious, and my number was on cooldown. Hooray! A week with no communication. Discord is so committed to being the best place to talk that I can't even talk!

That was it for some time, but I happened to develop bots in a certain controversial server. Somebody hated this server so much that they used an automated program to make a bunch of accounts and report me on all of them. If Trust and Safety gets a lot of reports for a singular user, they automatically terminate them. You'd think this was fine, because appeals exist, right?

Appeals do NOT exist.

All they give you back is a useless copy-paste automatic response that tells you to read the incorrect ban reason you received originally. To add to this, they banned the server I used for evidence. What kind of monkey management are these people under? I had Nitro on my account as well, but NO, they care so little about the end user that they might as well not exist.",Discord deserves to die in agony and…,1,GB

Unfortunately, I forgot to save my backup codes, so I told myself, ""Fine, I'll use the authenticator to log in again, like I always did."" Unfortunately, I'm not that lucky. I struggled for several hours last night to scan the QR code and get a six-digit number to log into my account. I used two portable devices and various applications, but to no avail.

The QR code is broken because every time I scan it, an error occurs, indicating that the problem is with them rather than my phone. I reported this, and they couldn't help me. It's absurd that I can't access my account, according to Discord Twitter support. The only solution they gave me was to create a new profile. I have a lot of connections through my Discord account and files through important direct messages. Another laughable thing about them is how they can delete my account, but they cannot disable two-factor authentication for security reasons.

for those who dont know, when you get the verification screen your locked out of your account, and are FORCED to verify by phone, and if your phone is a prepaid phone or landline you get rejected, it has to be mobile to verify, and mine is mobile, but i could not verify, and i emailed support and they flat out said ""we will not be removing the phone verification connected to your account"" and the verification systems there to prevent bots, but its pretty clear im no bot if im emailing and giving my number.

Then without any warning at all, my account was permanently disabled. I got a single email that gave a multitude of *possible* reasons(none of which I had done) for my account to be disabled, and it instructed me to submit a ticket for help.

When I attempted to submit an appeal ticket, I was told that the decision was final with no further explanation. No matter how many tickets I sent I always got the same cold response as if I had done some horrible unforgivable thing, yet nobody would tell me what it was.

Then I made a new account, and after several weeks, managed to find most of my contacts. However my cell phone number would not work for 2FA. Instead of offering any help whatsoever, Discord support repeatedly closed my tickets as solved after either telling me what I already know, ""The number isn't working"" or not giving a response at all.

No matter how many days you wait, they dont respond, after it mentioning that creating too much tickets puts you down in a longer queue. But what can you do if they dont respond, all you get is a BOT RESPONSE. ""Reply to this ticket if you still need help and we'll direct you to a member of the team"" BULLSH1T.

My account got disabled and only way to get it back was to cancel the dispute i did, which i did cancel and my account is still disabled and im getting no reply back for over a week so it might get deleted and if it does so, i will report this as a scam to my bank that i'm getting blackmailed to do something to get it back when im simply not getting anything back and they've taken my money from me and my account is disabled, cannot even cancel the subscription. They reply twice with the same bot message on my other email when i stated that they reply to my other email but not my discord linked email because you need to claim ure the owner from the original email u created the account but how is it possible to do so if they dont bother replying.

2018-12-05,Fraser Dunn,"Absolute joke of a company and service.

As of right now, the app lets you spam emotes in bulk which, due to extremely poor optimization, will lag any non-new gaming PC user to oblivion and back. Adding on-top of that, both voice-chat and the messaging service are extremely unstable with them turning people sounding like robots & disconnecting at completely random times and text messages taking AGES to be delivered or not (again, completely randomly) be delivered at all which is ironic as they created this crap to begin with for a chat service ""that works"".

They have recently added a game-store (which you can't opt out of) slowing down the performance of the app even more that has something called ""Nitro"". A subscription service that lets you bulk-play a bunch of game they choose.. Some of which require extreme amounts of time to beat The kicker is: Once the subscription ends, so does your ability to play said games AND your associated save-files. Discord is basically holding them hostage behind pay-walls.. On-top of this, there are no reviews whatsoever for any of the games put on the store (User or from"" professionals"") leaving it waving in the wind on whether or not the thing you buy will be complete garbage or not.

Moving on to their support which not surprisingly have been bombarded here already, is laughable. A friend of mine recently got DOX'ed by another Discord user. He was reported and got subsequently banned after slow response times from support but to my surprise, the banned user didn't take 2 minutes on hopping onto his alt-account, naming it the same as his old and beginning to do all the nasty stuff he was doing previously. I pointed this out to their support, even re-reporting the account and the support said, and I quote: ""Yo dawg we only ban the offending accounts we don't care about alts :^)"". Reporting someone for extreme behavior to get them banned basically does nothing, summed up as from what I've been able to tell, they only do IP's at most which is pathetic.

To be honest I wasn't expecting a refund but I was hoping for a response with a bit more empathy and any other company would either a) issue a refund or b) award me with a month of nitro. Considering I don't even use the other account and haven't even logged in since redeeming it, I really feel mugged off, especially for paying for another month.

I can't support a company like this.

TLDR; company is not on your side, use at own risk. Should be fine in the most cases but if anything did arise, they clearly won't even try to help. If you don't believe me, check out the other reviews; why haven't discord responded to anyone?",Terrible customer support,1,GB

2021-12-26,Grent Litu,"Discord is inept. Straight to the point, let me tell you why;
1. They have this thing where they will literally block you out of your account due to ""SuSpiCiouS BehAvIorRRR"". They're just allowed to do that. They will then tell you to give out your phone number to verify it. Why? Why??? Okay. So you go through that process and it's whatever. BUT. Say that you use two different accounts, whether it's for talking to different people, owning a server with your alt for security reasons, and having a separate account for mingling/business. Okay. Now get this. You get locked out of one account and do what I said above. OH. BUT BE READY. ONCE YOU GET LOCKED OUT OF THE OTHER ACCOUNT IT'LL TELL YOU TO DO THE SAME THING BUT THEN LITERALLY BLOCK YOU OUT BECAUSE ""THIS NUMBER WAS RECENTLY USED"", BASICALLY YOU CAN'T HAVE MORE THAN ONE ACCOUNT OR YOU WILL BE LOCKED OUT OF THE OTHER ONE WITH NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT UNLESS YOU HAVE TWO PHONES OR KNOW SOMEONE WHO WILL LET YOU USE THEIRS. -1/10. No. Negative ONE out of even the most MEDIOCRE score anything can ever achieve.
Please share this so that these ""people"" can see this. They won't do anything about it but it'll be nice to let them know how stupid they are. Here's some more ""minor"" complaints that everyone else globally has. (I say minor but that's because to me personally the one stated above truly is bad to me. Just my preference opinion but factually it's a super up-there level of bad.)

- Their support is god awful. Yes, you've probably heard of this so many times before and it's why this app gets a 1.8 stars which is good. They deserve it. From condescending CHILDISH messages like ""Sorry! Our wizards couldn't help you with this! Their magic channeling wasn't accurate enough!"" (They've actually acknowledged this one and have ""fixed"" it since. I say that in quotes because it's still an occurrence) to literally not even having the ability to help you recover a 2-step account, these robo-Oh. I mean HUMANS... are just so downright useless it's not even worth hitting that support button. Oh God yes. Speaking of 2-step...
- THE 2-STEP. THE FLIPPING 2-STEP. OH MY GOD. THESE CLOWNS!!!! Their 2-step is SO SO SOOO BAD AND FLAWED!!! I can't say that without any more passion! Get this (AND IT'S RELATED TO PHONE TOO -- HOW FUNNY IS THAT???) I've actually lost two of my last most major accounts in 2020 because on my old phone I used their scandalously bad 2-step 3rd party Authy on it. It was literally fine... thought that was it? No. Now get ready. Say, did you experience a human incident like breaking your phone? Phone not working? Phone too old? Or maybe even you got a new phone for Christmas! That's exciting. Guess what. You. Can't. Access. Your. Accounts. Anymore. That's right. Authy will only work on the phone you set it to and no more. Maybe there is a way to get it to work on your new phone but my experience was breaking my phone, getting my old one, and getting a nice warm welcome to having all of my accounts literally inaccessible because guess what? IT'S ON MY BROKEN PHONE THAT DOESN'T WORK YOU ABSOLUTE MORONS AUTHY AND DISCORD!!! Also Authy's support is just as bad as Discords. I already explored all of what little options Authy gave me because I was so passionate about getting my old accounts again... ahh, I've moved on since then, but get this -- Authy has no support. They blatantly say (in corporate speak of course)... and I QUOTE... ""if you are unable to recall your Backups password, any existing encrypted 2FA account tokens will be permanently lost"". OH? YOU MEAN THE BACKUPS PASSWORD I SET ON MY BROKEN PHONE THAT DOESN'T WORK ON MY NEW ONE? INCREDIBLE!!! (I'll try sending pics of this soon so I can show you people... if I can.)

These are the issues I, and so many others I'm sure, have had with this... horrible... HOOORRIBLE app. 
I literally never do criticism nor complain -- I've always just kept issues I had with anything to myself because it was just ""whatever"" to me, eventually. But this app... because of the fact that you're getting locked out of random from so much history... friends, servers, even a private server if you use it for documentation... I seriously had to write this whole thing just for myself because of how fed up I am of having to use this thing daily. However, even though I wrote it for myself too, I wrote it especially for other people looking this app's reviews up and needing to see what it is. The amount of stress this app gave me is not worth even tapping the download button whatsoever. If you're really going to use this app then my ultimate suggestion to you is to not get attached nor use it for anything major at all because before you know it all it takes is one ""WE SENSED SUSPICIOUS STUFF!!! GIMME YOUR PHONE NUMBER!!!"" or breaking your phone then you're locked out. Egregious. Thank you if you read through this.","Words to describe Discord; Inept, disrespectful, and cold",1,US

I tried to get in contact with Discord in... the two avenues they suggest and have for support (Twitter and a support ticket/email). Both ignored completely not to even give me a reason WHY I was banned. On top of that, they charged me for another month of Nitro while I could not access my account while banned (to cancel or otherwise) then it got completely DELETED after two weeks.

The only way I managed to get their attention was contacting them through the Better Business Bureau where they finally responded and while they did refund me, they never gave me a reason.

This is hugely disappointing as I've loved Discord for many years now since 2016 and never thought something like this would happen. Which is why I trusted the Nitro to be free in the first place. 

But it seems Discord is just going downhill and is trying to get as much money from people as it can even by stealing it right out of your pocket! Never again will I trust Discord. As they are just like any greedy company these days. A far cry from the company they used to be when I first joined.

Edit: I found where to ask for a refund and my request for a refund has been refused as I expected. Apparently they have a ""strict refund policy"" that only allows you to be refunded once.

2019-07-05,Ian Mannix,"Discord is a direct competitor of YouTube in terms of how bad their customer service is. They have NO warnings and they don't give a single ounce of heck about their customers. They can only ban someone and that ban is permanent and often done without them actually bothering to ""investigate"" anything so the people get banned for things said out of context or simply by being associated with something offensive.

People are getting banned left and right for reasons ranging from saying a mildly offensive joke and up to having done nothing wrong at all and just being in the wrong place and in the wrong time. If you attempt to appeal all they will tell you is that they have ""looked into the original report"" and will not do anything about it. They won't even tell you what exactly got you banned. Lost years of chat logs and hundreds of friends? Tough luck pal!

When Valve strikes you with their VAC they are only banning you from one game, but Discord bans you from accessing all of your games.

When Twitter takes down your tweet they will point out exactly what got you in trouble, but Discord won't even tell you what did you do wrong.

And the best part? The actual people who raid and doxx people are simply getting their new accounts over and over. This isn't stopping them in the slightest, and never will. Only the legitimate userbase is suffering.

If you wanna know what does it feel like to be a '1984' character just post one joke or say something about furries and you will get a full experience.

2022-08-27,SUAHUAB,"So let me tell you how unlucky I am..

Recently my phone broke, I had Google Authenticator on that which had my Discord 2FA Code.. I got a new phone, tried to see if it was possible to transfer my 2FA code to my new phone which isn't possible without the other phone since I need to scan a QR code.

I've contacted Discord Support, asked them if I could get 2FA removed or a new primary password so I could login and remove 2FA. The funny part is, they say they can't remove 2FA due to security reasons but they can delete my account. The other funny thing is, it looks like if you got your account hacked and the hacked enabled 2FA they can delete 2FA..

What I have tried
1. Try a few passwords I thought it could be.

2. Using my phone number, but it doesn't give me a 6 Digit when it's asking for it, but it just sends me an email with a restart password where I have to use 2FA once again.

3. Contact support, they literally can't do anything since all they say is ""Due to security reasons we can't remove 2FA"". Then why can Humblebundle do it, well you see they have something where you can sent them a receipt which I tried on Discord Support but didn't work.

Discord is an okay application where I can chat with my friends, but guess what I've lost a few of those people now since I can't access my account anymore. 

So this is actually the first time in my 20 years I've had this sort of worst Support.

Great Job Discord.","Discord an okay app, Support just sucks",1,DK

The support is completely useless. Incompetents, unprofessional and disrespectful!
I have sent tickets to ask for an explanation and the only answer is that they already explained this in the email I got when the account was suspended which is a complete lie. that email just say taht I violated the terms bla bla bla.

2023-12-18,hubba bubba,"To be honest, Discord is still one of the best chat platforms. Yes, there is a ton of unnecessary features and the Nitro subscriptions can get a little annoying, but you can still do everything you could do when the app launched, no problem.
My big complaint is that Discord recently changed the layout of the mobile app. Previously, the server bar was located on the bottom of the screen, easy to access with one hand. Recently, they changed that so the servers are on the far left side of the screen, in order to be more consistent with desktop. This forces you to reach the top left corner of your screen, the farthest distance you can reach with one left hand. This is just a minor complaint, however.
Overall, I wish they would stop adding stupid features like profile frames and profile effects, but at the same time, if it makes it so the service lasts for even just a month longer, whatever.",Overhated,4,US
2023-04-05,Timothy,"It's rather fitting that Discord haven't responded to bad reviews in the past 12 months, because their customer support seems to be terrible on every platform.
Had my account compromised, which was completely my fault, but it's been a week and haven't gotten any response on any website I've tried getting in touch on.
No response on twitter, no response on their any of their support email addresses (a number of them just say ""don't email this email address), and no other way of contacting them.

I was trying to get an answer for how I've broken them with over 14 emails sent. Half the time they pretended to be a robot and the other half they were trying to be as little helpful as they could to deter me from sending more emails.
I never broke any of these rules and now I've lost my contacts and info stored (through messages).

2022-07-31,zinigo,"Morbius is a 2022 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, produced by Columbia Pictures in association with Marvel. Distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is the third film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU). Directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, it stars Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius, alongside Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, and Tyrese Gibson. In the film, Morbius and his surrogate brother Milo become living vampires after curing themselves of a rare blood disease.

There were several attempts to bring Morbius to the big screen since 1998, including joining the Blade franchise and having a solo film produced by Artisan Entertainment, neither of which ever came to fruition. After announcing plans for a new shared universe of films inspired by Spider-Man related characters beginning with Venom (2018), Sony began developing a film based on Morbius. Sazama and Sharpless had written a script by November 2017, and Leto and Espinosa officially joined in June 2018. Work on the film began at the end of the year with further casting, ahead of production starting in London in February 2019. Filming was confirmed to have been completed by June 2019, with reshoots happening in Los Angeles the following February.

Morbius premiered at the Plaza Carso in Mexico City on March 10, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on April 1, 2022, after being delayed several times from an initial July 2020 date primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It received largely negative reviews from critics, with criticism towards its writing, visual effects, and post-credits scenes, though Smith's performance received some praise, and became the subject of various Internet memes. Though it performed reasonably well on its opening weekend, the film underperformed overall at box office and only grossed over $163 million worldwide against a $75–83 million budget.",Amazing app,1,RO
