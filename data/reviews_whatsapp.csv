We have one chat group where we‚Äôve had a few discussions. We‚Äôll go for a week or two without chatting at all, and then chat for maybe a day or so.
A few days ago when we were chatting I received a video in a foreign language from someone I had never heard of. I asked the others on the chat if they had received it and they had not. 
Apparently a person I never heard of was able to send me a video from another country with no explanation.
I checked my WhatsApp privacy settings and they were all set to Everyone and automatic download. Apparently this made it possible for a total stranger to send a video that was automatically downloaded into my camera roll.
This is extremely careless of WhatsApp! Are they trying to facilitate viruses and stalking? I am so accustomed to programs having reasonable security settings, I never thought of checking them.

2016-08-07,Simon,"I use a Blackberry phone because it is the only reliable smartphone with a keyboard and as a disabled person I am unable to use touchscreens.  I also use Whatsapp to stay in touch with my friends and my carers and healthcare providers.  As such Whatsapp provides me with a life saving service.

I have been dismayed that Whatsapp are ending the Blackberry service and I have now messaged them FOUR times to seek advise on what keyboard phone I can use for Whatsapp in future but have received no reply whatsoever. I have even emailed their Press Office but again no reply.

It is clear that now Facebook have got hold of Whatsapp that they no longer care about customers and especially those like me who are disabled and rely totally on our phones.

Can someone somewhere please help me and tell me what keyboard driven phone I can use in the future.

2023-02-23,ASOEBI LAWAN,"The Quick & Best Ways How, Nobody wants to be in a hopeless relationship. Often times people find themselves to be victims of a cheating spouse. The big concern about this is that you may not even know if your lover is cheating on you. People go for months even years not knowing until they finally find out. Even worse, they find out from everyone else who's been knowing making them look some what foolish. Wouldn't you like to save your time, effort, and emotions by finding out right now? I sure would and here's how, There's so many ways to catch a cheater that one article alone couldn't cover them all, however, I'm going to go over some quick and effective ways on how to catch a cheater. Plan a vacation or some sort of business/family trip. Tell your lover what day you are expected to be back. So many people tend to cheat when they know their lover is out of town. The trick here is to show up around three to four days earlier than what you've told them. Also be sure to not tell anyone of this because you never know who he has on his side. If your lover has been recently working late hours at the office. Then it would be in your best interest to find out if he's really working. Show up at his office during the night shift with some form of gift. Whether it be something like his favorite dish that you cooked for dinner, etc. This is to help you not seem so suspicious of his actions. Check his cell phone. So many people use cell phones for all of their contacts and often times people who cheat either saves their significant other's phone number or it's left in their calls log. Check the dialed and received calls log and take note of any phone numbers which look suspicious. Aside from this yiu need UNIVERSALSPYSOLUTION on Gmail who is the best SPY to remotely get into your PARTNER phone without physical contact .

But you know what - they DON‚ÄôT CARE. It is all deliberate - designed to stop customers seeking help - arrogance of the highest order.

There is an issue with the Chat Auto Backup - the issue is quite simple - IT DOES NOT WORK. I have had this problem for most of this year. And despite numerous attempts, WhatsApp have FAILED MISERABLY to resolve. In fact, their favourite tactic is to just push back on the customer - they NEVER want to accept responsibility for anything or acknowledge anything is wrong.

Now get this: their latest solution (sent by a very rare email) FAILED. So, I replied to THEIR email on the very issue. Their reply was INCREDULOUS: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, this issue is out of scope of WhatsApp Support!‚Äù.

How can that be when THEY sent the VERY EMAIL offering THEIR solution (that did not work) on the VERY ISSUE being discussed?

Like I said - it is all a deliberate ploy to stop users contacting them.

Either that, or the people employed in WhatsApp support are illiterate, and completely and utter STUPID.

But you know what - it doesn‚Äôt matter how many people write bad reviews - nothing will change - THEY SIMPLY DON‚ÄôT CARE.

2021-12-27,Aptivi,"My family has been using WhatsApp ever since they got their hands on their first Android phone somewhere around 2012-2014, and they're still using it for communication. I hate to admit that I was the last in person who officially started using WhatsApp in late 2020, despite having my first Android phone in 2014.

They all use this app to communicate with family members and friends. I use it personally to do the same thing. However, as a student, I tend to use this app more for communication with classmates and best friends and being in the group of our class for updates regarding studying.

However, I was subject to a Syrian harasser who's not in my school and a person whose name I don't know who added me to a group without my permission which has a group of morons who's ready to harass me and their victims. I left and reported the group, blocked the person, reported them, and I never heard from them since.

My phone is rooted and WhatsApp worked as if nothing happened for more than a year. I can receive and send messages as usual. I can even send messages to a classmate who's using an iPhone and receive messages to Android. That is cross-platform messaging (Send on iOS and receive on Android, or the other way around).

The other flaw is that you need to update the app constantly, as failure in doing this step may lead to the app telling the user to update before starting again.

When it comes to notifications, it's very smart. Turn off your WiFi and/or data, wait for your group or your contacts to send you messages in the meantime, then turn on the WiFi and/or data. An influx of notifications that shows that you've received these messages appears. When WhatsApp detects that there's a new message, it briefly shows ""Checking for new messages"" in the notification panel before showing the message. This system ensured that I don't miss any message, although I don't know if this same experience applies to iOS.

You can even insert your custom background as your chat background and make the whole app turn into dark mode on supported and unsupported devices.

2023-04-24,rose,"I really want to know if it's possible to forward messages and photos in the same order.
Say for example I have this in one chat...
Message 1
Photo 1
Message 2
Photo 2
Photo 3
Message 3
Photo 4
I want to be able to forward those messages and photos in that sequence to another chat.
However, what inevitably happens is that all the messages go through first... in the right order:
Message 1
Message 2
Message 3
Followed by all the photos... jumbled up:
Photo 4
Photo 2
Photo 1
Photo 3
This is my first time contacting customer support and I found it utterly soul destroying.
First they sent a standard response that didn't answer my question, just telling me how to forward messages generally. Then there was the genius idea of restarting my phone... you know when they tell you to restart your device they've got nothing.
When I persevered they told me they weren't able to understand me. English is my first language and I think my writing skills are good but I was told to try to be AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE.
Finally, they sent a very vague response which didn't specifically refer to my question... there's no personalisation... but referred to the ""intended functionality"". I asked them to confirm it wasn't possible to do what I was asking but I got a quite frankly rude reply saying I'd already received an answer... and then no further response.
I don't believe it's their intended functionality. Who INTENDS for people to receive forwarded messages and photos all jumbled up... why would anyone want that? They obviously just don't have a way to do it and don't want to admit it.
I was shocked by the ""support"" anyway. The company obviously has a horrible image and reputation globally... their questionable (at best) morals are well known. Why would you want to be rude and unhelpful on top of that? They obviously don't care about their customers. The support is completely useless and unapologetically so. It also seems cold and unfriendly to not use names... it's just a faceless ""customer support"".
It's obvious why I use WhatsApp... because everyone does... but I absolutely hate the company and what they stand for and I'm even more clear now about the contempt they have for their customers. There's something in the media about WhatsApp maybe moving out of the UK if some new online safety laws are passed. I wouldn't mind. I would find some way to adapt as I'm sure everyone would.","Horrible horrible customer ""support""",1,GB

2023-03-19,Renzo Schauwecker,"This review focuses only on the customer service.
Whatsapp has become a necessary evil. This means that although many of us would like to try an alternative app, convincing all your contacts to move to another app would be quite difficult or impossible. It is a tad like Microsoft, that although there might be much better products out there, we just got used and dependent on it / them. These companies know about this and that is the reason why they don't really need to spend a lot or any resources on providing a true customer service. They know you would stick to using them, no matter what. These are the terms and conditions and that's it. They don't really care about you / us.
Having said that, this review focuses on one particular experience. My data.
I have never been very fond of creating backups in the ""cloud"" and I agree I am quite old school, creating backups on my PC. The reason might be the same as why I am writing this review. I want to have access to my information and data and not be subject to yet another provider's terms and conditions.
The PC backups I created on my PC can not be accessed anymore, after my mobile phone died. They are encrypted and there is apparently no way to restore or access them. Tried different alternatives and just because I don't go with the flow of allowing my data to be stored somewhere else, I can not access my data. Feels like data ransom to me. Anyway, I just got used to the idea of having lost all my historical information with no one to help me.
This does not even mention, what whatsapp / facebook might actually doing with my data on the first place, but the fact that I can not even access it, is just somehow astonishing.
As some users have mentioned, it used to be a great app, until it was acquired by Meta / FB.

I cannot stress how stupid this app is and how many hours i've wasted trying to figure out how to get a damn video chat going on my laptop. not to mention how I risked gtting viruses. I am using my 6 year old's laptop to download an emulator so she can talk to her friend who moved to Italy. If her computer gets a virus from this I am going to tell her it is the fault of Whatsapp and facebook for making it so hard for a little kid to talk to her best friend who moved. You should cut out the middle man (emulator). I really want to know the thought process of whoever thought it was a good idea to make this an app but only have video and voice compatibilities on mobile. Please please please explain this because I am trying to put theories together on why it wasn't made possible. So again all I can think of is this is stupid. Why are there so many downloads of this stupid app? What am I missing? What is the appeal? I put all other communicative apps above this one. My expereince has been awful. Hopefully I am able to download an emulator and I don't get a virus on this laptop.

2023-10-20,Michael In Paris,"I connected to WhatsApp Web on my PC. Right after I linked it with my smartphone, it briefly displayed a list of all my conversations, and a few seconds later only those that were not archived, the archived ones being accessible by a button which appeared too. But in the non-archived ones a conversation with a group I had just joined was missing, although it had been initially displayed in the list of all conversations. So in WhatsApp Web, it is inaccessible, while it is in WhatsApp Desktop.
All my reports to their ""support"" (including a video shot of the process) were replied to by irrelevant messages.",WhatsApp Web doesn't display all conversations,1,FR
