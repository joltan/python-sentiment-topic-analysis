Problem is the camera of my old phone doesn't work and the only answer I got from their support was one by a chatbot that didn't respond to my actual problem. So please if there is any other way of transferring my chats without having to scan this QR code I'd be happy to hear from signal by a real person.","Heading":"only a chatbot for support is not even close to enough","Rating":1,"Location":"DE"}

{"Date":"2023-07-23","Author":"Will Hoskings","Body":"Cool app!  I regularly use it to talk to my friends.\nPersonally, I'd much prefer it over Discord, Teams, et. al. as it's much more secure with its end-to-end encryption.\n\nI'll deduct a point for no GIFs on desktop though.  It's been an issue for what... 5 years now, and it's still missing.  My friend is constantly complaining about it, pointing out that GIF support is present on mobile.  I do agree: why hasn't it been implemented already?\n\n(P.S. regarding my quasi feature request: I'm a Signal supporter, which means I give \u00a35\/mo to support their cause.  I believe this gives me some grounds to ask for features without being entitled.)","Heading":"Cool app","Rating":4,"Location":"GB"}

What text, images, or behavior do you see on your screen? Is this for voice messages or during audio or video calls?\n\nme - No, the messages sound is fine. It's the ringing for voice calls and video calls. The sound is extremely low.\n\nsignal - Got it. Is your overall phone volume adjusted high enough before these calls come in?\n\nme - Yes everything is as high as it can go.\n\nsignal - Does this happen with every single contact you call?\n\nme - It's not when I call,it's when they call me, that's when the phone rings right? Your phone doesn't ring when you call others, it rings when others try to call you, since the first phone was invented ...right?

{"Date":"2021-05-09","Author":"Chetan Bhasin","Body":"It's got some catching up to do, but I'm already very, very happy with the service.\nCross-platform application with audio+video call support, the open source software with strong end-to-end encryption and Signal protocol, and surprisingly good audio\/video call quality for a company that runs on donations.\n\nThe UX could be better, but a designer could tell that it's built for accessibility and not for aesthetics. That doesn't mean the UI couldn't be more pleasing. Signal is still my preferred app, and will remain so, but I hope they keep improving the UI alongside other features.\n\nWhile Signal still has ways to go, I'm very confident in their ability to build on top of their already excellent product.\nHaving said that, I'd appreciate an Apple Watch app though. :D","Heading":"Going Strong","Rating":5,"Location":"DE"}

Feels like somebody is not a fan of Apple or something like that.\n\nEDIT: \nNow my 3rd attempt to post in their community forum got also deleted it was the following: \n\n\"Pleas make this work normally like WhatsApp can do it. People switch to Signal because MMS is getting stopped but then discover you can't send picture with full support is not good.\" Deleted by Admin because its inappropriate. Logic much?\n\nTurns out a certain \"Herohtar\" keeps deleting my posts. Apparently \"i got nothing new to say\" ... aehm well - thats like your opinion friend.

How can you transfer something if you can't obtain it in the first place? They could have just implemented Bitcoin Lightning payments instead.
