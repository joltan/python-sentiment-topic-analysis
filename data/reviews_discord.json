{"Date":"2022-03-20","Author":"Paladin","Body":"I'm reposting my review here as well so people can read my experience to make up their own minds about using Discord. \n\nBefore my account was disabled 1 week ago I knew it was becoming a bigger and bigger issue that discord was just banning more and more people at will with their automated systems. I just didn't believe i would get hit with their bs. Yes there are spammers and abusers on discord. Yes there are issues. However their coding programs have also victimized legit users who do not deserve an instant account ban. I count myself amongst those. I'm happy that I never spent money on nitro or anything like that. I would never want to support the kind of direction Discord is going now.\n\nYou are not even told in an appeal what part of the TOS you broke. They do not care about their users at all. They know they don't need us as they got enough users now and can get away with it. But eventually you are going to lose more and more members to other competitors. Look at Facebook its going down hill as well. I believe the best time of discord has passed and its only going down hill and eventually getting back smaller years from now and someone else will take the center stage.\n\nThe customer support on discord doesn't exist. I mean they just can't follow up with the support tickets or they ghost you.

{"Date":"2021-01-25","Author":"Professor Zephyr","Body":"Horrendous app.\n\nI've been using Discord since 2017 and the app is progressively getting worse and worse. It's horrible. It legitimately makes me want to quit using the internet as a whole.\n\nThere are nearly no upsides to using Discord at this point. Public servers have nothing but mic spamming trolls and vile children and even grown adults who take pride in making your day miserable. \n\nIn smaller servers, there are pedophiles and child predators roaming the app daily. This app is also horrible at monitoring viruses and malware that are distributed daily. On another note, they ban users for nearly no reason. Friends of mine have received bans they cannot appeal because they are terminated of suspected \"fraud\". None of these friends even know how to do this. Also, Discord is horrible at monitoring messages that are dropped in servers. Some Discord users will go out of their way to dox, or leak personal information (such as real names and birthdays, emails and even passwords). Discord is also horrible at taking legal action to those who scrape info from servers. This information usually includes registered emails, server IDs, message IDs, user IDs and even avatars. These emails are then looked up in database dumps and more sensitive info can be retrieved. Because Discord allows you to report message IDs, user IDs, server IDs and emails, this info is public. Scrapers literally retrieve this info from their API, which can be publicly used. Because account terminations are based entirely off of message links, users can report messages that are simply suggestive or a joke, and you can be terminated for this. \n\nDiscord also has an awful reporting system if you haven't gotten that point earlier on in my report. Response times are decent, but in order to successfully report users, you have to copy a message link which is enabled by their \"Developer Mode\" option. Unfortunately, if you simply delete that message, Discord cannot terminate that person. Screenshots are also not allowed. Someone infected your PC with RAT malware, allowing them access to your entire PC and you threatened to report them? Simple fix! All they have to do is purge their chat with you, which can easily be done with a Github program that is very accessible on the site. Your daughter got caught up with the wrong person on the app and sent them naked pictures or suggestive pictures at all and the pedophile deleted his messages? That's too bad. Discord doesn't allow screenshots and your daughter may receive an account termination if she was under the age of 13, or sent naked pictures in a non-NSFW chat, because both of those go against their Terms of Service. Discord also does not allow video files or audio files to be reported. Some admitted they have your info and they are going to release it? Too bad, no message link to grab (because there are no messages if you're in a voice call) means no report. Because you cannot report a user directly from their app, you have to do so through their FAQ section on their site (which is a little difficult to navigate at times, not even going to lie), users cannot report people through their app, making reporting people even more difficult. Awful to think about, isn't it?\n\nAlthough this app is subject to everyone's personal experience and I do respect that, I would not recommend this to literally anyone. I would highly recommend not using this app. It's that awful.","Heading":"Horrendous app.","Rating":1,"Location":"US"}

I've also met the love of my life on the app, someone who I've been with for two years. Before I got this app I had lost my dad and since then I've been going through some of the toughest years of my life but a lot of my friends on discord as well as my lover have kept me going.  I can't be thankful enough, I have my bad moments, we all do but this app has saved me and helped me so much. So to the discord team, thank you. For all the hate you guys get and how fickle the community can be I'm so happy you guys stuck it out and made this person's life better. Discord truly is like a home to me and I will always be remember and be thankful for the app. I aspire to work for discord one day, as a little sign of my gratitude. I didn't didn't I'd cry while writing this review but I suppose that discord would be one of the things to do it. Happy Thanksgiving, thank you for giving me hope and a life I could never have without you guys. \n\nTo the discord staff team.\n\nSincerely, Asir.","Heading":"I think discord is taken for granted.","Rating":5,"Location":"US"}

You can do 'anything' from simply chatting to playing text games or even creating your own Discord bots. \n\nThe complexity of the sophisticated functions have also been massively simplified to the point where just about anyone can perform the sophisticated functions like bot creation which requires basic scripting knowledge which can be learnt off the internet in a few hours.\n\nYou can create a server and create specific subsections called channels to maintain a neat and tidy community or wreak havoc by creating a server with roles like 'Big Boss' or 'Wumpus Overlord' to assert dominance and create channels titled 'spam', 'spam-1', 'spam-2' with no context apart from server members spamming like crazy in the server.\n\nApart from the amazing functions and memes of Discord, the company also values their customers. They create hilarious ads and I love their marketing structure. Discord has amazing staff that interact closely with their users via Social Media platforms like Twitter or through Official Discord Servers! They also keep in touch with the latest memes and times. \nFor example, right now in the COVID19 situation, it's hilarious seeing Discord try so hard to incorporate a myriad of new functions to support the need for home-based learning and online meetings etc.\nFrom allowing video calls and conferencing to be held within servers to incorporating noise-cancelling features, Discord has very well cemented itself amongst the best video conferencing and telecommunication app.\n\nHeck, the best part is...\nIt's completely free to use!","Heading":"Writing this review during COVID19","Rating":5,"Location":"SG"}

{"Date":"2020-07-08","Author":"Ena Ilferd","Body":"When I used Discord, I tried to get help from customer support. That is when I got automated robots giving me messages that look like they were written by comedic kids rather than professional adults. If you do not meticulously take care of the process of trying to get those childish robots to do their \"jobs\", then those robots will reject your request to get your problem solved. Customer support service in Discord is a complete joke. I can't even get into my Discord account anymore that won't get deleted because I keep failing to send the right phone number from my own phone to verify my Discord account. Once I changed my phone number from my phone service provider the 2nd time, I was done with Discord. Because I don't have time to deal with an extremely faulty platform from Discord that's not run by professional humans in the customer support service as much as the customer support service is run by childish robots who don't know how to talk with common sense to the point that it's autistic. I need real people with real common sense that will actually help me in the Discord customer support service because robots are not very good still in the year of 2020. Besides that, Discord's system bans people for no logical reason sometimes to the point that it's stupid. Never trust your money with Discord is what I recommend you do. People have had unexpected charges in their bank account from Discord's shady business model. If you are honest about you being against homosexuals, the transgender community, feminists, Muslim feminists (even though Muslim feminists are hypocrites because Muslim feminism is an oxymoron because Islam and feminism are complete opposites), and other liberal things, your account could likely get banned from the Discord system because Discord is controlled by multicultural hypocrisy that paradoxically doesn't accept people with different point of views because Discord is a biased echo chamber.

Nothing...The guy is still on the server now laughing at everyone because he got away with it so discord just made us all look like dumbasses.\n\nSecond case: Reported a guy who was threatening to bomb places and mosques and after the recent events i fount this to be highly unacceptable, What happened? Provided evidence and IDs and got ignored. \n\nThird case: Reported a guy who was selling leaked files and copyrighted content on his discord server, reported that and what happened? They claimed they cant delete a server for that? so nothing happened.\n\nForth case: Reported a server that was self botting thousands of members with evidence and was using the fake member count to trick people into buying ads on his server, Sent evidence and got told \"Botting isn't a big issue ;)\" Okay? So everyone can just bot servers? That seems right, doesn't it?\n\nFifth case: Reported 2 members with video clips and screenshots of them telling me they're going to ddoss my community which they did (had logs from the host) and discord told me its not their problem? pretty sure ddoss threats is against your TOS? But at this point, they don't care about paedophiles so i'm not surprised they don't care about ddossing.\n\nOverall: discord support is the most useless staff team i have ever come across, They don't deal with anything and you might aswell just break the TOS back or retaliate back because reporting people is useless, But is anyone surprised?

{"Date":"2020-06-29","Author":"Crypto Discord","Body":"Honestly, the bad reviews are just venting about how people got banned for 'nothing', Discord only bans if the reason is valid and against their TOS. Either way, Discord is an amazing platform providing many opportunities for Developers, gamers and so much more people. It caters to these people in a way that no other social media platform can, providing some of the best servers for some of the best games, and even allowing users to create their bots with Discords very own API, mainly used in js and py. But don't expect your average social media platform when you hop onto Discord, because that's not what you're getting with this platform. No one can explain how great Discord is in just one review, but Discord has made it clear they care about their users, and their users in return care about them. I am an every-day and heavily dependant Discord user and Discord bot developer. I just wish I could explain how amazing Discord is for hosting communities, but lets put it simply; try it for yourself without breaking ToS, and you'll like it.

{"Date":"2022-04-05","Author":"Joe Baker","Body":"NOTE: I want to say that Discord has changed the way they \"process\" these requests since this occurred. In June 2021, their Privacy Policy stated:\n\n\"In addition to the functionality available through the \u201cSettings\u201d of the Services, in which you can correct, update, amend, or delete certain personal data, you can also request other modifications from us directly. Please write us at privacy at discord.com with the words \u201cPersonal Data Request\u201d in the subject or body of your message, along with an explanation of what data subject right you are seeking to exercise.\"\nThis clause has since been removed. The privacy at discord.com was the ONLY email mentioned on that page at that time. Since then they have added a clause that states: \"You can contact Discord\u2019s Data Protection Officer at dpo at discord.com.\" HOPEFULLY this is a dedicated point of contact for data requests now. Here is my main review:\n\nThey do not comply with GDPR requests.\n\nMy account was disabled summer of 2021 for reasons they would not tell me. This happened while I was using the account, so I knew exactly when it happened.\n\nI used their GDPR contact point (privacy at discord.com) to send them a data request for my account's data. After all, I wasn't told why I was banned, and I didn't want to lose all of my information.\n\nThe initial email stating my account was disabled stated that they anonymize\/delete user data within 14-30 days after disabling an account.\n\nHere's how they got me: \nThe timeframe for them to respond to a GDPR request is 30 days. Yet they delete account information within 30 days after an account is disabled. I figure that since I sent the GDPR request minutes after my account was disabled, they would simply hold off on deleting my data until my data request was processed.\n\nWrong! They didn't acknowledge my data request, stating the email privacy at discord.com is only for questions about privacy and not for data requests. They haven't responded to any later emails.\n\nIn conclusion, in a couple months it will be 1 year passed since this occurred and they never even responded to say that my data had been properly deleted or not either...","Heading":"They do not comply with GDPR requests.","Rating":1,"Location":"CA"}

I have shown proof of my previous ownership of the account\n2. I have given proof that it has been compromised, as well as discord disabling the account\n3. I have multiple emails and password retries in order to try to get the account back\n4. The account did not have 2FA previously before the compromise. \n5. Yet discord can not disable multi-factor authentication that was added after the compromise occurred, this was the action of the scammer, not the account creator and user.\n6. Why is discord unable to disable factor authentication when it was clearly after a compromise in the account? Money was also lost through this account by the scammer using my debit card. \n7. The investigation concluded in my account just being unable to be fixed or given back after proof was given to support and offered to be deleted instead. This account can easily be recovered through the email if multi factor was turned off. It was taken over and hacked, that should leave discord capable of disabling multi factor on a compromised account to help the user get the account back not saying I can't because of \u201cprivacy and security reasons\u201d.\n\nThey proceed to \"solve\" a request in order to deny any help to the user, to ignore them and their problem, just so they can close the ticket and not deal with it. \n\nThe company doesn't care, won't help your issues, and basically ignore you anytime you need help.

{"Date":"2019-01-21","Author":"Adriel","Body":"At the start Discord was an amazing platform, now Discord kinda got into the catering for investors and the SJW crowd.\n\nYears later, they introduced 'Discord Game Store.' A feature no one asked for, something like Steam and Origin but for Discord so that you don't have to go to another client in order to play video games, do everything in one. They focused so much on this feature for so long that they forgot who made them, the community. They just wanted to be in that publishing space so bad and make even more money. Then they put in NSFW rules, where you can't be partnered (you will be denied partnership) if you have any NSFW content in your server\/guild because Discord wants \"guilds to be open to everyone that joins, no matter the age.\" Because Discord lacks a good CEO that doesn't want to put an age gate on Discord for certain servers\/guilds, they just ruin everyone else's experience for a lesser crowd. On a side note though, streamers and content creators that are partnered get the blind eye when it comes to this and don't get departnered. How nice.\n\nThe company stopped implementing ideas on feedback.discordapp.com. Hell, they promised theme packs that changes the Discord UI, sounds, etc and that\u2019s still nowhere to be found. Company is lacking in the PR communications. They\u2019re just like PUBG Corp, too busy making skins than making meaningful and weekly updates to fix the game.

As a communication platform it's been absolutely perfect, however, my credentials got hacked by a bot and started sending \"free subscriptions\" to everyone in every server I was in. \n\nAs you can imagine that adds up and is quite terrifying. I caught it fairly early on and my banking institution halted the fraudulent charges, however, any form of \"chargeback\" breeches Discord's ToS. My fault for not reading the fine print I suppose - But anyone would react swiftly if their financials were at stake. \n\nI reported the hack to them immediately but didn't know I had to handle the charges a \"certain way\" or risk losing the account being locked forever. At the same time I almost don't want the account back at all because I've no idea how it was compromised. I do want my information removed from it for obvious reasons - But I can always make a new one if needed.  \n\nDiscord has done nothing but send me automated responses that are neither helpful nor do they answer any questions. They locked the account NOT because of the reported hack (ironically I got another automated msg about it a week later saying there might have been suspicious activity) but because I dared to stop a bot from draining my accounts. \n\nThen proceeded to give me a warning about handling improperly. There has been zero support. Zero customer service. It's a trainwreck that THANK GOODNESS my financial institution is willing to help me sort out because sadly Discord is not. \n\nThis was an unfortunate set of circumstances. There's no obvious rhyme or reason for it. The hack wasn't Discords fault, nor mine, though I suppose that depends on perspective - But my issue raised with Discord is the absolutely atrocious way they handled their responses and completely blew me off for over a week. \n\nScams, hacks, bots are serious business.

I remember him accusing me of how I was sending multiple emails in hopes of getting different responses and \"threatening me\" to stop. How can I stop if my issue wasn't resolved or I didn't get satisfied with the \"canned responses\" that I received? In the first place, is that really professional to threaten your customer? No, I wasn't mad initially but the back-and-forth emails with different people answering fueled my frustration and in the end, I got that type of response????

I think that adding a whisper chat will really help Discord and the people that use it to play there games and talk with out any struggle. A whisper chat is a chat designed to communicate to other channels whilst being in one. When playing a game, you do not want to pause your game to click and join another channel, this could lead to stopping or ruining the game. What a whisper chat will do is allow people to talk with each-other when in different channels to make it easy to communicate.

First, I don't have my phone right now because I am grounded and it wouldn't let me on my account unless I verified my account WITH MY NUMBER. Which again I did NOT have access to. I made a new account thinking I could bypass it and since I only have one email I had to make another email. So I made another email and made a new account. BUT of course, it said the same thing about needing a number. So from 8 am to 10 am I was contacting all my friends on Instagram and asked for their number to use. I finally got a number but I didn't realize I still had opened the discord tab with the new account I had just made to bypass the verification thing. So I used the number of my friend on that account. When I realized that it was the wrong account I deleted the number off that account and tried using it on my old account. BUT it said it was used on another account. I soon found out that there is a timeout on numbers and I had to wait at least 14 days before I can use the number again. So I went back to Instagram and asked for more friend's numbers. Some said no but I had another friend say yes. SO I finally got the number and made sure I was on the right account. I put the number in and my friend gave me the code and BOOM I was in I was so excited I saw I had a ton of DMS on discord but I needed to tell my other friends that it worked. I went to the tab with Instagram and told the friend who gave me the number and the original friend. When I went to go back to discord to check those DMS I saw that it had logged me out so I went to log back in and it said \"your account has been disabled\" Which I went to my email to see if the support team had emailed me a response to an email I sent an hour ago (still has not responded) and it said that my account was disabled because I was either \n\"Sending a large number of direct messages in a short span of time\nParticipating in a server dedicated to spamming Discord\nAutomating your user account or self-botting\nTaking other actions on Discord \u2014 for example, joining a ton of servers \u2014 faster than humanly possible\nAttempting potentially fraudulent activity\" \nSOO the end of the story is...

{"Date":"2021-10-20","Author":"Kai Ulric","Body":"I have had my account for maaaany years and I help run several communities on it. I've never had a reason to contact their customer service, everything runs fine for the most part.\n\nAs of late discord seems to have a large number of bots trying to hack accounts to steal CC and PayPal info, sell accounts etc. I was always mindful of this, usually, they are easy to spot (this is my first time EVER being hacked on anything), it is a generic 'hey check this out' and a link. But recently hackers have taken it a step further. I got a message from a friend asking how I was doing, what was up, normal chat. We went on to have a 10-15 min conversation. He asked me to check something out for him, doesn't seem unusual because he runs big communities.\n\nWell, it wasn't him, it was a hacker pretending to be my friend, so my account was hacked. Yeah, my bad... I didn't know this new strategy until it was too late and the friend hadn't reached out in any way to let people know they had been hacked and to be careful (which I want to say I started telling people asap and asked them to spread the word). This happened to many of my friends too, people who are very good at watching for bots, being tricked by these people acting like your friends to get your trust and make you feel nothing is out of the ordinary.\n\nSo yes, I was hacked. This was almost two weeks ago. I have sent in multiple tickets, 10+ emails updating my tickets on issues that the hacker is doing on my account. This included images of the hacker insulting my friend when he was trying to spread the info that I was hacked in one of my communities and openly saying that they were going to sell my account to someone else. I also DM'ed asking if there was anything else I could do to help the situation on Facebook and Twitter, plus multi @'s on Facebook and Twitter...\n\nDiscord has not contacted me in ANY way.\n\nI am also a Nitro user (their paid service) and still, I can't even get a message from their customer service saying they are looking into my situation. It's been radio silence.\n\nI have asked them to please switch ownership of some of the communities I run to friends who are the co-administrators that I trust so the hacker can't mess with them or delete them (some have hundreds of people in them) and still, zero contact and my admins have told me they still can't remove the hacked account (because I'm the main admin and they can't change that), so the communities are still in the hands of the hackers.\n\nMy friend was also hacked, and had their CC on their discord account for the renewal of their Nitro (paid account). The person who hacked them multiple times to charge HUNDREDS of dollars at a time to it, and had to cancel it. We all know what a pain that is, having to change all your account to a new card... they are also two-ish weeks in and still waiting for something to be done. \n\nUnlike other programs and websites, where if you try and change your info it either sends to a link in the email to do it, asks for a code from an email, or sends you the 'this info's been changed and if this wasn't you...' emails - I received nothing from Discord asking if this was done by me and if not here are the steps, or asking me to verify the change or even notified me there was a change.\n\nI know some will say that Discord has the 2fa on it. Well, another friend of mine had that activated on his account. He said it did nothing to stop his account from being hacked because of the way the hack works. Once you click the link, when it logged you out, if you never logged in again before reinstalling discord, you would be fine. But the second you log in, it sends them your account 'token' and with the token, they can log in with any browser without needing any other info. \n\nIn my case, I did uninstall and restart before trying again, but we also found out that whatever virus came with the link would auto reinstall discord and infect it again. In my case, we could not get it to stop reinstalling and had to wipe the drive.\n\nI will say, the program is nice for building communities and having all your friends in one place. The voice chat and screen share are also nice. But when it comes to contacting them for help or customer service, this is one of the worst, if not -the worst- experiences I have ever had trying to get in contact with a company to get any form of help. Especially when I have a paid account. \n\nBut they seem to have the time and staff to update their Facebook and Twitter about updating their store and asking you to spend money on their products... \n\nSo TLDR; the program is nice, needs more work on their security, I wouldn't store Paypal or CC info on the account for your sake... because with my first-time experience trying to deal with their customer service, I'm not sure if they exist and if they do - it could be a long time before you actually receive any kind of help if something goes wrong with your account.","Heading":"Good program, AWFUL customer service","Rating":1,"Location":"US"}

The cause was only said to be \"spam\/platform abuse\". Now, at first i was really confused, i stopped to think back if i might've done anything wrong but could not remember doing anything wrong.\n\nI went to open a ticket via their support basically saying \"Hey, what's going on? Why has my account been disabled?\".\n\nIt took 4 days for an answer to come and ever since, i've been receiving automated answers, that do not answer the questions, just telling me that my account was disabled because of an TOS or Community guideline violation. \n\nYou know what is funny? I had bought Discord Nitro only 2.5 months ago. \n\nUntil now, i've been very much supportive of Discord, i have liked using it, both owning 2 servers and participating in many, occasionally sharing memes and generally, trying to be a good guy, helping people on videogame modding Discords, when i've been able (I'm a hobbyist 3D modeler\/animator). I have even posted some tutorials for people on how to do basic modeling and animating. Few are those who would have a bad word to say about me. I have formed numerous friendships and connections over the years, and been a very active Discord user, using it pretty much everyday. \n\nAnd if not for my account being disabled, for NO reason, i would probably have been using Discord for many years to come. \n\nSeeing how unexistant the \"support\" they offer is, i can say that i feel scammed and angry. They could aswell just have no support at all, it would change nothing. Judging by my own experiences and those of others, who have been banned without a cause, i can say it, that my trust in Discord plummeted to below 0 in a manner of a few days. \n\nI have been seriously considering to abandon it for good, and if not for all the friends i have there, i would do so RIGHT NOW. And i still might do so within few days. This is no way to treat a honest customer.\n\nIf not for the fact that there is no support team, Discord might have been a decent platform. Oh well, time to see it for what it is and find another place to hang out, one that actually has a support, that is not an unfunny joke.\n\nDo yourself a favor, do not have ANYTHING on Discord that you would feel bad for losing.

You are asked if the bot helped, which in my case it did not and asked to reply to your email which i did. I have had no response from the Discord Support Team regarding this and have been informed by a friend that not only has he been removed from my server, that the hacker has also removed my friends and deleted my server. \nAll the while nothing from the Support Team, they could have quite easily froze my account preventing activity as soon as i reported a possible hack while they investigated, however i have now lost everything and that after being a Discord member for over 7 years is more than disappointing its damn right careless. How many more people have to lose their accounts and personal details before Discord realises this is a serious issue that needs to be looked at if they want users to use and trust their platform. \n\nFurthermore there is no point attempting to contact them via twitter they do not reply to your messages and if you tweet them your just told to go to the website support. \nFor a company your size your Support system should be more professional.","Heading":"An honest opinion!","Rating":1,"Location":"GB"}

Discord is so committed to being the best place to talk that I can't even talk!\n\nThat was it for some time, but I happened to develop bots in a certain controversial server. Somebody hated this server so much that they used an automated program to make a bunch of accounts and report me on all of them. If Trust and Safety gets a lot of reports for a singular user, they automatically terminate them. You'd think this was fine, because appeals exist, right?\n\nAppeals do NOT exist.\n\nAll they give you back is a useless copy-paste automatic response that tells you to read the incorrect ban reason you received originally. To add to this, they banned the server I used for evidence. What kind of monkey management are these people under?

Adding on-top of that, both voice-chat and the messaging service are extremely unstable with them turning people sounding like robots & disconnecting at completely random times and text messages taking AGES to be delivered or not (again, completely randomly) be delivered at all which is ironic as they created this crap to begin with for a chat service \"that works\".\n\nThey have recently added a game-store (which you can't opt out of) slowing down the performance of the app even more that has something called \"Nitro\". A subscription service that lets you bulk-play a bunch of game they choose.. Some of which require extreme amounts of time to beat The kicker is: Once the subscription ends, so does your ability to play said games AND your associated save-files. Discord is basically holding them hostage behind pay-walls.. On-top of this, there are no reviews whatsoever for any of the games put on the store (User or from\" professionals\") leaving it waving in the wind on whether or not the thing you buy will be complete garbage or not.\n\nMoving on to their support which not surprisingly have been bombarded here already, is laughable. A friend of mine recently got DOX'ed by another Discord user. He was reported and got subsequently banned after slow response times from support but to my surprise, the banned user didn't take 2 minutes on hopping onto his alt-account, naming it the same as his old and beginning to do all the nasty stuff he was doing previously. I pointed this out to their support, even re-reporting the account and the support said, and I quote: \"Yo dawg we only ban the offending accounts we don't care about alts :^)\". Reporting someone for extreme behavior to get them banned basically does nothing, summed up as from what I've been able to tell, they only do IP's at most which is pathetic.\n\nAvoid using this junk if you value your sanity and quality.","Heading":"Absolute joke of a company and service.","Rating":1,"Location":"SE"}

What I didn't know was I was logged in another account via the web browser. It doesn't even say on the gift confirmation page (only a redeem or exit). Considering you can't even redeem via the app, this is a pretty dumb design.\n\nAs a gesture of goodwill that I wasn't just after a free month's of Nitro or w\/e, I decided to pay for another and then contact customer services. It takes them approximately 1 day to respond and they responded with pretty much you're out of luck. To be honest I wasn't expecting a refund but I was hoping for a response with a bit more empathy and any other company would either a) issue a refund or b) award me with a month of nitro. Considering I don't even use the other account and haven't even logged in since redeeming it, I really feel mugged off, especially for paying for another month.\n\nI can't support a company like this.\n\nTLDR; company is not on your side, use at own risk.

{"Date":"2021-12-26","Author":"Grent Litu","Body":"Discord is inept. Straight to the point, let me tell you why;\n1. They have this thing where they will literally block you out of your account due to \"SuSpiCiouS BehAvIorRRR\". They're just allowed to do that. They will then tell you to give out your phone number to verify it. Why? Why??? Okay. So you go through that process and it's whatever. BUT. Say that you use two different accounts, whether it's for talking to different people, owning a server with your alt for security reasons, and having a separate account for mingling\/business. Okay. Now get this. You get locked out of one account and do what I said above. OH. BUT BE READY. ONCE YOU GET LOCKED OUT OF THE OTHER ACCOUNT IT'LL TELL YOU TO DO THE SAME THING BUT THEN LITERALLY BLOCK YOU OUT BECAUSE \"THIS NUMBER WAS RECENTLY USED\", BASICALLY YOU CAN'T HAVE MORE THAN ONE ACCOUNT OR YOU WILL BE LOCKED OUT OF THE OTHER ONE WITH NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT UNLESS YOU HAVE TWO PHONES OR KNOW SOMEONE WHO WILL LET YOU USE THEIRS. -1\/10. No. Negative ONE out of even the most MEDIOCRE score anything can ever achieve.\nPlease share this so that these \"people\" can see this. They won't do anything about it but it'll be nice to let them know how stupid they are. Here's some more \"minor\" complaints that everyone else globally has. (I say minor but that's because to me personally the one stated above truly is bad to me. Just my preference opinion but factually it's a super up-there level of bad.)\n\n- Their support is god awful. Yes, you've probably heard of this so many times before and it's why this app gets a 1.8 stars which is good. They deserve it. From condescending CHILDISH messages like \"Sorry! Our wizards couldn't help you with this! Their magic channeling wasn't accurate enough!\" (They've actually acknowledged this one and have \"fixed\" it since. I say that in quotes because it's still an occurrence) to literally not even having the ability to help you recover a 2-step account, these robo-Oh. I mean HUMANS... are just so downright useless it's not even worth hitting that support button. Oh God yes. Speaking of 2-step...\n- THE 2-STEP. THE FLIPPING 2-STEP. OH MY GOD. THESE CLOWNS!!!! Their 2-step is SO SO SOOO BAD AND FLAWED!!! I can't say that without any more passion! Get this (AND IT'S RELATED TO PHONE TOO -- HOW FUNNY IS THAT???) I've actually lost two of my last most major accounts in 2020 because on my old phone I used their scandalously bad 2-step 3rd party Authy on it. It was literally fine... thought that was it? No. Now get ready. Say, did you experience a human incident like breaking your phone? Phone not working? Phone too old? Or maybe even you got a new phone for Christmas! That's exciting. Guess what. You. Can't. Access. Your. Accounts. Anymore. That's right. Authy will only work on the phone you set it to and no more. Maybe there is a way to get it to work on your new phone but my experience was breaking my phone, getting my old one, and getting a nice warm welcome to having all of my accounts literally inaccessible because guess what? IT'S ON MY BROKEN PHONE THAT DOESN'T WORK YOU ABSOLUTE MORONS AUTHY AND DISCORD!!! Also Authy's support is just as bad as Discords. I already explored all of what little options Authy gave me because I was so passionate about getting my old accounts again... ahh, I've moved on since then, but get this -- Authy has no support. They blatantly say (in corporate speak of course)... and I QUOTE... \"if you are unable to recall your Backups password, any existing encrypted 2FA account tokens will be permanently lost\". OH? YOU MEAN THE BACKUPS PASSWORD I SET ON MY BROKEN PHONE THAT DOESN'T WORK ON MY NEW ONE? INCREDIBLE!!! (I'll try sending pics of this soon so I can show you people... if I can.)\n\nThese are the issues I, and so many others I'm sure, have had with this... horrible... HOOORRIBLE app. \nI literally never do criticism nor complain -- I've always just kept issues I had with anything to myself because it was just \"whatever\" to me, eventually. But this app... because of the fact that you're getting locked out of random from so much history... friends, servers, even a private server if you use it for documentation... I seriously had to write this whole thing just for myself because of how fed up I am of having to use this thing daily. However, even though I wrote it for myself too, I wrote it especially for other people looking this app's reviews up and needing to see what it is. The amount of stress this app gave me is not worth even tapping the download button whatsoever. If you're really going to use this app then my ultimate suggestion to you is to not get attached nor use it for anything major at all because before you know it all it takes is one \"WE SENSED SUSPICIOUS STUFF!!! GIMME YOUR PHONE NUMBER!!!\" or breaking your phone then you're locked out. Egregious.

Although all of the Discord features, such as nitro, communities, and badges are super awesome, I just think the age limit should be lowered. Maybe 10+ or 11+. Some children are getting on to Discord, JUST to get some actual friends, and they keep on getting banned and banned for doing nothing. Maybe Discord can make a \"Kid Friendly Server\" feature. If you enable it for your server, children can search up a server, and they can join it without having any older-age actions going on. For example, if the feature is ticked, there should be no swearing on the server, no NSFW on the server, etc. I just think little children should be allowed to have as much fun as older teens in their childhood, just with no bad actions.","Heading":"New server feature?","Rating":4,"Location":"US"}

They have NO warnings and they don't give a single ounce of heck about their customers. They can only ban someone and that ban is permanent and often done without them actually bothering to \"investigate\" anything so the people get banned for things said out of context or simply by being associated with something offensive.\n\nPeople are getting banned left and right for reasons ranging from saying a mildly offensive joke and up to having done nothing wrong at all and just being in the wrong place and in the wrong time. If you attempt to appeal all they will tell you is that they have \"looked into the original report\" and will not do anything about it. They won't even tell you what exactly got you banned. Lost years of chat logs and hundreds of friends? Tough luck pal!\n\nWhen Valve strikes you with their VAC they are only banning you from one game, but Discord bans you from accessing all of your games.\n\nWhen Twitter takes down your tweet they will point out exactly what got you in trouble, but Discord won't even tell you what did you do wrong.\n\nAnd the best part? The actual people who raid and doxx people are simply getting their new accounts over and over. This isn't stopping them in the slightest, and never will.

Yes, there is a ton of unnecessary features and the Nitro subscriptions can get a little annoying, but you can still do everything you could do when the app launched, no problem.\nMy big complaint is that Discord recently changed the layout of the mobile app. Previously, the server bar was located on the bottom of the screen, easy to access with one hand. Recently, they changed that so the servers are on the far left side of the screen, in order to be more consistent with desktop. This forces you to reach the top left corner of your screen, the farthest distance you can reach with one left hand.

Distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is the third film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU). Directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, it stars Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius, alongside Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, and Tyrese Gibson. In the film, Morbius and his surrogate brother Milo become living vampires after curing themselves of a rare blood disease.\n\nThere were several attempts to bring Morbius to the big screen since 1998, including joining the Blade franchise and having a solo film produced by Artisan Entertainment, neither of which ever came to fruition. After announcing plans for a new shared universe of films inspired by Spider-Man related characters beginning with Venom (2018), Sony began developing a film based on Morbius. Sazama and Sharpless had written a script by November 2017, and Leto and Espinosa officially joined in June 2018. Work on the film began at the end of the year with further casting, ahead of production starting in London in February 2019. Filming was confirmed to have been completed by June 2019, with reshoots happening in Los Angeles the following February.\n\nMorbius premiered at the Plaza Carso in Mexico City on March 10, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on April 1, 2022, after being delayed several times from an initial July 2020 date primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It received largely negative reviews from critics, with criticism towards its writing, visual effects, and post-credits scenes, though Smith's performance received some praise, and became the subject of various Internet memes. Though it performed reasonably well on its opening weekend, the film underperformed overall at box office and only grossed over $163 million worldwide against a $75\u201383 million budget.","Heading":"Amazing app","Rating":1,"Location":"RO"}
