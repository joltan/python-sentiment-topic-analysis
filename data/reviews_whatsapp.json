The big concern about this is that you may not even know if your lover is cheating on you. People go for months even years not knowing until they finally find out. Even worse, they find out from everyone else who's been knowing making them look some what foolish. Wouldn't you like to save your time, effort, and emotions by finding out right now? I sure would and here's how, There's so many ways to catch a cheater that one article alone couldn't cover them all, however, I'm going to go over some quick and effective ways on how to catch a cheater. Plan a vacation or some sort of business\/family trip. Tell your lover what day you are expected to be back. So many people tend to cheat when they know their lover is out of town. The trick here is to show up around three to four days earlier than what you've told them. Also be sure to not tell anyone of this because you never know who he has on his side. If your lover has been recently working late hours at the office. Then it would be in your best interest to find out if he's really working. Show up at his office during the night shift with some form of gift. Whether it be something like his favorite dish that you cooked for dinner, etc. This is to help you not seem so suspicious of his actions. Check his cell phone. So many people use cell phones for all of their contacts and often times people who cheat either saves their significant other's phone number or it's left in their calls log. Check the dialed and received calls log and take note of any phone numbers which look suspicious. Aside from this yiu need UNIVERSALSPYSOLUTION on Gmail who is the best SPY to remotely get into your PARTNER phone without physical contact .

Don't let them scam you further! When they tell you that you need $200-$300 or more to continue working, DON'T DO IT!  But I'm letting you know so that you don't give them ANY money!

Many people may use older Android phone FOR A REASON, but in my case, this would be about a perfectly working SURFACE PRO X latest updated Windows10 which is in fact runs neither on 64bit nor on 32, because it has an ARM based processor - so it CANNOT actually \"update its operation system\" to Whatsapp's limited favor. But they won't bother to read my issue nor answering it for over full week now, I send desperate messages to their so-called \"support\"-line nearly every day, and all they do is only trying to guess useless problems by a stupid bot.

{"Date":"2021-12-27","Author":"Aptivi","Body":"My family has been using WhatsApp ever since they got their hands on their first Android phone somewhere around 2012-2014, and they're still using it for communication. I hate to admit that I was the last in person who officially started using WhatsApp in late 2020, despite having my first Android phone in 2014.\n\nThey all use this app to communicate with family members and friends. I use it personally to do the same thing. However, as a student, I tend to use this app more for communication with classmates and best friends and being in the group of our class for updates regarding studying.\n\nHowever, I was subject to a Syrian harasser who's not in my school and a person whose name I don't know who added me to a group without my permission which has a group of morons who's ready to harass me and their victims. I left and reported the group, blocked the person, reported them, and I never heard from them since.\n\nMy phone is rooted and WhatsApp worked as if nothing happened for more than a year. I can receive and send messages as usual. I can even send messages to a classmate who's using an iPhone and receive messages to Android. That is cross-platform messaging (Send on iOS and receive on Android, or the other way around).\n\nThe other flaw is that you need to update the app constantly, as failure in doing this step may lead to the app telling the user to update before starting again.\n\nWhen it comes to notifications, it's very smart. Turn off your WiFi and\/or data, wait for your group or your contacts to send you messages in the meantime, then turn on the WiFi and\/or data. An influx of notifications that shows that you've received these messages appears. When WhatsApp detects that there's a new message, it briefly shows \"Checking for new messages\" in the notification panel before showing the message. This system ensured that I don't miss any message, although I don't know if this same experience applies to iOS.\n\nYou can even insert your custom background as your chat background and make the whole app turn into dark mode on supported and unsupported devices.\n\nThe last thing which I will tell you is that it's owned by Facebook (Mark Zuckerberg). The latest version of the app shows that it's from Metaverse.","Heading":"Decent and dynamic messaging app despite flaws","Rating":4,"Location":"SY"}

Then there was the genius idea of restarting my phone... you know when they tell you to restart your device they've got nothing.\nWhen I persevered they told me they weren't able to understand me. English is my first language and I think my writing skills are good but I was told to try to be AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE.\nFinally, they sent a very vague response which didn't specifically refer to my question... there's no personalisation... but referred to the \"intended functionality\". I asked them to confirm it wasn't possible to do what I was asking but I got a quite frankly rude reply saying I'd already received an answer... and then no further response.\nI don't believe it's their intended functionality. Who INTENDS for people to receive forwarded messages and photos all jumbled up... why would anyone want that? They obviously just don't have a way to do it and don't want to admit it.\nI was shocked by the \"support\" anyway. The company obviously has a horrible image and reputation globally... their questionable (at best) morals are well known. Why would you want to be rude and unhelpful on top of that? They obviously don't care about their customers. The support is completely useless and unapologetically so. It also seems cold and unfriendly to not use names... it's just a faceless \"customer support\".\nIt's obvious why I use WhatsApp... because everyone does... but I absolutely hate the company and what they stand for and I'm even more clear now about the contempt they have for their customers. There's something in the media about WhatsApp maybe moving out of the UK if some new online safety laws are passed. I wouldn't mind.

{"Date":"2023-03-19","Author":"Renzo Schauwecker","Body":"This review focuses only on the customer service.\nWhatsapp has become a necessary evil. This means that although many of us would like to try an alternative app, convincing all your contacts to move to another app would be quite difficult or impossible. It is a tad like Microsoft, that although there might be much better products out there, we just got used and dependent on it \/ them. These companies know about this and that is the reason why they don't really need to spend a lot or any resources on providing a true customer service. They know you would stick to using them, no matter what. These are the terms and conditions and that's it. They don't really care about you \/ us.\nHaving said that, this review focuses on one particular experience. My data.\nI have never been very fond of creating backups in the \"cloud\" and I agree I am quite old school, creating backups on my PC. The reason might be the same as why I am writing this review. I want to have access to my information and data and not be subject to yet another provider's terms and conditions.\nThe PC backups I created on my PC can not be accessed anymore, after my mobile phone died. They are encrypted and there is apparently no way to restore or access them. Tried different alternatives and just because I don't go with the flow of allowing my data to be stored somewhere else, I can not access my data. Feels like data ransom to me. Anyway, I just got used to the idea of having lost all my historical information with no one to help me.\nThis does not even mention, what whatsapp \/ facebook might actually doing with my data on the first place, but the fact that I can not even access it, is just somehow astonishing.\nAs some users have mentioned, it used to be a great app, until it was acquired by Meta \/ FB.\nHoping you are not experiencing such a frustrating experience.","Heading":"Customer Service non existent","Rating":1,"Location":"DE"}

I am using my 6 year old's laptop to download an emulator so she can talk to her friend who moved to Italy. If her computer gets a virus from this I am going to tell her it is the fault of Whatsapp and facebook for making it so hard for a little kid to talk to her best friend who moved. You should cut out the middle man (emulator). I really want to know the thought process of whoever thought it was a good idea to make this an app but only have video and voice compatibilities on mobile. Please please please explain this because I am trying to put theories together on why it wasn't made possible. So again all I can think of is this is stupid. Why are there so many downloads of this stupid app? What am I missing? What is the appeal? I put all other communicative apps above this one. My expereince has been awful.

I began to receive inappropriate and inadequate answers. There were about 8 letters by email and about 4 by the support option in the phone, I attached screenshots.\nEach time they advise something completely inappropriate, as if they didn\u2019t read the messages at all, they ask you to describe the problem (again and again !!!) and repeat the same thing again, tell some program functions, like an encyclopedia. Then, they just closed the chat without any reason and without solving the ticket.  It was the worst communication with support in my life, I would say - no communication. Most likely, a robot writes there and you will never get a normal answer, they don\u2019t give a damn about your problems.

Videos often send as gif, without sound, without and prior notification of this. \n\nAlso their \"Support\" is non existent - and I have tried to contact them on at least 4 occasions. Every time they did absolutely nothing to solve the issue at hand. They put up a facade of a person and wasted my time by replying like a literal bot (which it very likely is - at least invest in some chat gpt bot, Jesus). And any information I included in my message was completely ignored.","Heading":"Horrible Windows App","Rating":1,"Location":"DE"}

So in WhatsApp Web, it is inaccessible, while it is in WhatsApp Desktop.\nAll my reports to their \"support\" (including a video shot of the process) were replied to by irrelevant messages.","Heading":"WhatsApp Web doesn't display all conversations","Rating":1,"Location":"FR"}
